# chroma

What I've been hacking at lately: general color-space transformations in the spirit of Chroma.js

## Usage

Use leiningen to fire up the repl and play around.

## Current Issues

Presently having trouble coercing the input data (ie color values as represented by RGB, CIELab, HSL or HSV 3-tuples) into the proper numeric types for processing.
